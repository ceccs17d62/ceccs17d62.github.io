						<div id="item1"><span>chicken</span>
							<p>Chicken fried rice is the comfort dish of Chinese food. It's been around for a very long time and is also common in East, Southeast, and South Asian cuisines. The dish started as way to use leftover fried rice that has dried out some and may not be great on its own, but is still perfectly edible. The addition of oil and soy sauce and veggies and meat spruce up the rice for a delicious meal. A traditional Chinese fried rice would be made in a wok over high heat, but we've made ours in a cast iron skillet since they are more common in home kitchens. This take on the favorite is easy to make and makes the perfect lunch or dinner.</p></div></a></div>
